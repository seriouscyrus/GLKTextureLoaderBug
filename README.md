# GLKTextureLoaderBug
Texture loader loading a blue scale texture from Photo library image when viewed in iOS Simulator.

Quick dirty project showing the texture loader loading a bluescale image when in an iOS Simulator for some reason. 

Uses Photo Library framework and GLKit, requires permission to access photos.

Pretty sure it's an Apple bug.
